== Description ==

Provides A nice Frequently asked Questions Page with answers hidden untill the question is clicked then the desired answer fades smoothly into view.
Having FAQ's on one page can help improve customer service by providing immediate answers 24/7. Unfortunately,
most FAQ pages are either one very long page full of questions and complete answers,
or a single page of questions that link to separate answer pages. Both solutions
slow down the visitor's search for answers: in the first case, forcing a visitor to scroll
down a long page for the question and answer she's after, and in the second case,
making the visitor wait for a new page to load.
This light weight plugin uses the already installed wordpress jquery library to solve that problem. 
Multiple Categories of FAQ's are now supported. See Installation for details.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create Questions and Answers using the FAQ menu in the admin.
   Note: On the FAQ edit or Add New page, the title should be the question and the body the answer.
1. Place [smart_faq] short Code in a default wordpress Page for displaying the Frequently asked questions
1. For multiple categories, you can use [smart_faq cat=category-slug]  where category-slug is the slug of the category of FAQ's You want to display
